<p class="standfirst">The release of my blog is long overdue but I'm happy to say that it's now here!</p> 
<hr>
I've designed it in the browser to save Photoshop faff and I'm using [Jekyll][jekyll] - a simple static site generator - to keep things simple.

Wordpress was an option, and I'm reasonably familiar with it, but for speed and efficient code Jeckyll is a fantastic solution. Cheers to my friend, [Ben Foxall][ben] for the help and tips! Bootstrap comes to the rescue for base and responsive styles. It gets knocked as a tool but to me, it's invaluable.

Design-wise, I'm using google fonts for the typography. I'm using Noto Serif for the heading text and the lovely PT Serif for body text. I pumped up the font size for enhanced readability - hopefully!
