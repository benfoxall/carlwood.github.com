<p class="standfirst">The release of my blog is long overdue but I'm happy to say that it's now here!</p> 
<hr>
I've designed it in the browser to save Photoshop faff and I'm using [Jekyll][jekyll] - a static site generator - to keep things simple.

Wordpress was an option and I'm reasonably familiar with it, but for speed and efficient code, Jekyll is a fantastic solution. Cheers to [Ben Foxall][ben] for the help and tips! Bootstrap comes to the rescue for base and responsive styles. It gets knocked as a tool but to me, it's invaluable.

Design-wise, I'm using google fonts for the typography; Noto Serif for the heading text and the lovely PT Serif for body text. I pumped up the font size for enhanced readability - hopefully! I hoped to capture the serif and journalistic style of my favourite blogs. Word to [Trent Walton][trent].

There's still work to be done in terms of polish: browser and device testing and cleaner CSS/markup, to mention a few, but I'm happy just to push this out there.

coda: screw you, IE
